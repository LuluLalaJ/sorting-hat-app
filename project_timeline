- Finish basic Javascript 
    - Maybe each of us can create a particular section of the code to work on? 
    - for instance, Melissa works on the #house-bar, Michael works on submit form, Chen works on drop-down function? 
    - Or if we have 2-hour work session: 1 hour working independently and 1 hour work together with the driver/navigator system 
- Create super simple css so that the page looks clean  
    - Chen will look into the basic css

# 04-05 Wednesday
- Finalize MVP  
    - The goal is to have all the functionality working, even if it looks super simple;
    - So that we can improve the codes and make it prettier later while not breaking the code 

# 04-06 Thursday
- Refracting Javascript 
- Edit CSS so that the page looks prettier 
# 04-07 Friday

# Basic Guideline
- Whenever work on a new feature (such as additional functionality), do so on a new local branch
- Discuss together before merging 
- Commit regularly, name each commit concisely and meaningfully by starting with a verb
    - such as 'add eventlistener to submit button' etc.
