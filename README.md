# Sorting Hat Website 
We are excited to welcome you as a full time student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!

## Magical Features
Click on the various house crests to learn what animal represents said house. When you are ready,\
answer the sorting hats questions as best you can to so we can determine what house you shall be\
placed in. The sorting hat will consider all of your answers and place you in the house that best\
fits you!

Once you have been placed in a house, you will be given a password to your dormitory. Once inside,\
you will be given access to that house's history and you will also get to meet all of your new roommates!

## Usage
The sorting hat takes three answers and calculates the best house for you based on your selections. Each answer\
is weighted towards a specific house and the house with the most points is chosen to be yours. Once chosen, the page\
returns the password for that specific house allowing you to access various details for whichever house was chosen.

## Support
If you feel you were placed into the wrong house by the sorting hat, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\
offers full time counseling as the sorting hat never makes a mistake!
