# Sorting Hat Website 
Discover your Hogwarts House! As a new Hogwarts student, I can click on the images of the four houses and learn about each school. I will then answer a quick question about my personality and the website will sort me into one of the four houses. When a house is chosen, I will have access to the password to the common room. When I submit the password and my name, I will have access to more information about my house, including other students who are in the same house!
